            <p>obviously my family. my wife and i have a son and a daughter, and i just love spending time with them, along with the rest of my crazy family - consisting of 2 brothers and a sister.</p>
            
            <p>so something very close to my heart is basketball - i've played and coached at a number of levels ...</p>
            <p>highlights of my playing career are being fortunate enough to play in the national basketball league, which is south africa's professional league, as well as playing against the south african national senior men. being selected as western province u18 boys coach, as well as coaching my beloved montana vikings basketball club's u18 boys in the national club championship finals were incredibly special moments [vikings took silver in that game]</p>
